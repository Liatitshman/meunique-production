# 📋 Vercel Deployment Checklist - Step by Step

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Check:

### 1. Verify Files Are Ready:
- [✓] `💡_MEUNIQUE_ENGLISH_SYSTEM.py` - Main app in English
- [✓] `api/index.py` - Points to English version
- [✓] `requirements.txt` - All dependencies listed
- [✓] `vercel.json` - Configuration ready

### 2. Test Locally:
```bash
# English version should be running on:
# http://localhost:8508
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel
After logging in, run:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 2: Answer Prompts:
You'll see these questions - here's what to answer:

```
? Set up and deploy "~/Desktop/🧠 Agent_Navigator_Cursor_Sync"? [Y/n]
👉 Type: Y

? Which scope do you want to deploy to?
👉 Select your account (probably your email)

? Link to existing project? [y/N]
👉 Type: N (unless you already have a project)

? What's your project's name? (agent-navigator-cursor-sync)
👉 Press Enter (accept default) or type: meunique

? In which directory is your code located? ./
👉 Press Enter (current directory)

? Want to modify these settings? [y/N]

```

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Open: https://vercel.com/dashboard

4. Click on "Domains" in the left menu

### Step 2: Add Domain
1. Click "Add Domain"
2. Type: `meunique.io`

### Step 3: Configure DNS
You'll see instructions like:
```
Add the following records to your DNS:

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21

OR

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Step 4: Update Your Domain Provider
1. Go to your domain provider (where you bought meunique.io)
2. Find DNS settings
3. Add the records Vercel showed you
4. Save changes

## ⏱️ Wait for DNS Propagation:
- Usually takes 5-30 minutes
- Maximum 48 hours
- Check status: https://dnschecker.org/#A/meunique.io

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Setup:

### 1. Environment Variables (Optional)
In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```env
# For AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# For database (later)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# For analytics (optional)
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-...
```

### 2. Test Your Live Site:
- [ ] https://your-project.vercel.app works
- [ ] https://meunique.io works (after DNS)
- [ ] All features working
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Fast loading

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### If deployment fails:

vercel logs

# Try again with debug
vercel --prod --debug

# Or force rebuild
vercel --prod --force
```

### If domain doesn't work:
1. Wait more time (DNS can be slow)
2. Check DNS records are correct
3. Try: `nslookup meunique.io`
4. Contact domain provider support

### If app crashes:
1. Check logs: `vercel logs`
2. Verify all files uploaded
3. Check environment variables
4. Try simpler deployment first
